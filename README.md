# ruby-5-card

This is a simple 5 card poker score counter. 
It builds a deck of cards, shuffles them and then deals out two hands of 5 cards. 
The scoring class takes the hands and checks for various conditions, assiging each hand scores (in the form of an array) based on this.
It then prints out the winner between the two hands.
